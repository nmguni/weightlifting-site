            <span class="strong">"olympic weightlifting</span> otherwise known as ‘weightlifting’ or ‘Olympic-style weightlifting’ is a registered
            sport which incorporates the use of two independent lifts which require the athlete to lift a loaded barbell
            from the floor to an overhead position in an explosive manner. The two lifts, the ‘Clean & Jerk’ and the ‘Snatch’
            are explosive movements as they require a combination of maximal strength and maximal speed."</p>

                <p class="">Competition to establish who can lift the heaviest weight has been recorded throughout civilization, with
                  the earliest known recordings including those found in Egypt, China and ancient Greece.
                  <p>
                    <br> Today, the modern sport of weightlifting traces its origins to the European competitions of the 19th
                    century.
                    <p> The first male world champion was crowned in 1891; the weightlifters were not categorized by weight at
                      this time, and a women's championship did not exist until 1987. </p>

                <span class="card-title">early olympic</span>
                <p class="">The first Olympic Games of 1896 included weightlifting in the Field event of the predecessor to today's track
                  and field or athletics event.
                  <p>In 1920, weightlifting returned to the Olympics and the competition lifts were the 'one hand' snatch, the
                    'one hand' clean and jerk and the 'two hands' clean and jerk. </p>
                  <p>At the next Olympic Games, in Paris, France, in 1924, the 'two hands' press and the 'two hands' snatch
                    were added to the program, making a total of five lifts. </p>
                  <br>

              <div class="card-panel eal darken-1">
                <span class="card-title">modern olympic</span>
                <p class="">After the 1972 Olympics, the clean and press was discontinued due to difficulties in judging the event. Athletes
                  had begun utilising their hips and leaning backwards substantially rather than 'strictly' pressing the
                  weight overhead with an upright torso.
                  <p> What remained are the two elements of the modern Olympic weightlifting program – the snatch and the clean
                    and jerk. The snatch consists of lifting the barbell from the floor to an overhead position in one fluid
                    motion. The clean and jerk consists of moving the barbell from the floor to overhead in 2 movements:
                    from the floor to the shoulders, and from the shoulders to overhead. </p>

            <span class="card-title">Women</span>
            <p>As early as 1986, there were official world championships awarded to women weightlifters such as Karyn Marshall
              and Judy Glenney. However, it was not until the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia that an official Olympic
              competition for women was introduced.
              <p> In 2011 the International Weightlifting Federation ruled that athletes could wear a full-body "unitard" under
                the customary weightlifting uniform. Kulsoom Abdullah became the first woman to do so at the U.S. National
                Championships that year, and athletes are allowed to do so at the Olympics. IWF rules previously stated that
                an athlete's knees and elbows must be visible so officials can determine if a lift is correctly executed.</p>

                  <p>Olympic weightlifting uses a steel bar (also known as a barbell) with larger-diameter rotating sleeves
                    on either end, holding rubber-coated weight plates of different weights. This sleeve rotation is important
                    for the Olympic lifts, particularly the snatch and clean movements, because it drastically reduces the
                    rotational inertia of the bar. Without sleeve rotation, the Olympic lifter faces more challenging lifts
                    and a greater risk of injury</p>

                    to the bar. The colour designations for these iron plates are as follows: 1 kg is green, 1.5 kg is yellow,
                    2 kg is blue, 2.5 kg is red, 5 kg and 0.5 kg are white. It is useful to note the colour assignment of

            <p> Born 27 July 1984 Lu is a Chinese weightlifter, Olympic champion and four time world champion competing in the
              77 kg category until 2018 and 81 kg starting in 2018 after the International Weightlifting Federation reorganized
              the categories</p>
            <p>Lü was born in a village administered by Qianjiang City, Hubei Province. His father, Lü Yuan, and the rest of
              his family were farmers. When he was 13 years old he joined a local sports school to be trained as a weightlifter,
              which was an opportunity to escape rural poverty. In 1999, to remove the financial burden on Lü's family, his
              coach Dengling Hu sent him to join the provincial team.</p>

            <p>Heading into the 2012 Summer Olympics Lü was the heavy favorite to win. He ended up winning the gold medal at
              the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 77 kg class with a total of 379 kg.His snatch of 175 kg set both a world and
              Olympic record, as did his total of 379 kg, for the 77 kg class.
              <p>Due to an error during the snatch phase, Lü was unable to attempt his third lift at 177 kg. He was again the
                heavy favorite to win gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics.</p>
              <p>He finished the snatch phase with a new world record of 177 kg, but did not win gold due to
                <a href="#Nijat">Nijat Rahimov's</a> clean and jerk world record of 214 kg. Lü had the same total, but Nijat Rahimov won due
                to virtue of a lighter body weight.</p>
